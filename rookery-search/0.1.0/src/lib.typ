// @rheo/rookery-search — fuzzy search over a rookery.
//
// Reads the corpus through `@rheo/rookery`'s public primitives and never
// touches its internals: `ideas()` for the notes, `note-href()` for links.
//
// Two layers, and the split matters:
//   - `search-ideas(query)` is pure Typst and works under plain
//     `typst compile` — build a static list of matches with no JavaScript.
//   - `search-index()` and `search-bar()` are RHEO ONLY. The bar's script is
//     injected by rheo from this manifest's `js_scripts`, and the index links
//     to minted note pages, which only rheo produces.
//
// BUILT, unlike `@rheo/rookery`: `typst.toml` points at `dist/`, and `dist/`
// comes from `just build` (vite copies this file and the CSS across and
// bundles `src/rookery-search.js` into `dist/lib.js`). Editing `src/` does
// NOT take effect until you rebuild — the one ergonomic cost of shipping JS.
